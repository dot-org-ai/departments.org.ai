| schedulePreventiveMaintenance | Plan and track routine maintenance intervals based on mileage, hours, and calendar triggers |
| manageFuelProgram | Monitor fuel consumption, manage fuel cards, and optimize fueling strategies |
| trackVehicleLifecycle | Maintain records for each asset from acquisition through depreciation and disposal |
| analyzeFleetCosts | Evaluate total cost of ownership including maintenance, fuel, insurance, and depreciation |

## Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| fleetManager | Oversees all fleet assets, budgets, and lifecycle planning |
| maintenanceScheduler | Plans preventive and corrective maintenance work orders for fleet vehicles |
| fleetAnalyst | Analyzes fleet utilization, cost trends, and replacement timing |
| vehicleInspector | Conducts pre-trip, post-trip, and periodic vehicle inspections |
| fuelProgramCoordinator | Manages fuel cards, monitors consumption anomalies, and negotiates fuel contracts |

## Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Vehicle | A fleet asset with registration, specifications, and lifecycle data |
| MaintenanceWorkOrder | Scheduled or unscheduled repair and service task for a specific vehicle |
| FuelTransaction | Individual fueling event recording volume, cost, location, and vehicle |
| InspectionRecord | Documented results of a pre-trip, post-trip, or periodic vehicle inspection |
| VehicleLifecyclePlan | Projected acquisition, depreciation, and replacement schedule for a fleet asset |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| registerVehicle | Add a new vehicle to the fleet with registration, specifications, and assignment |
| scheduleMaintenanceWorkOrder | Create a preventive or corrective maintenance task for a specific vehicle |
| recordFuelTransaction | Log a fueling event with volume, cost, and odometer reading |
| conductVehicleInspection | Perform and document a pre-trip, post-trip, or periodic vehicle inspection |
| retireVehicle | Remove a vehicle from active service and initiate disposition |
| analyzeFuelEfficiency | Evaluate fuel consumption trends and identify anomalies across the fleet |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| vehicleRegistered | A new vehicle was added to the active fleet |
| maintenanceWorkOrderCompleted | A scheduled or corrective maintenance task was finished and the vehicle returned to service |
| fuelAnomalyDetected | An unusual fuel consumption pattern was flagged for investigation |
| inspectionFailed | A vehicle inspection identified deficiencies requiring corrective action |
| vehicleRetired | A vehicle was removed from active service and marked for disposal |
| maintenanceDueAlertRaised | A vehicle reached a preventive maintenance trigger for mileage, hours, or calendar |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findVehiclesDueForMaintenance | List vehicles approaching or past preventive maintenance intervals |
| getFleetUtilization | Retrieve utilization rates, mileage, and idle time by vehicle or category |
| searchOpenWorkOrders | Find maintenance work orders in progress or awaiting parts |
| getFuelCostByVehicle | Summarize fuel spend and efficiency metrics for a specific vehicle or group |
| findVehiclesForReplacement | Identify vehicles exceeding age, mileage, or cost-per-mile replacement thresholds |
| getInspectionHistory | Retrieve inspection records and deficiency trends for a vehicle |
