| Prototype | Interactive clickable prototype used for validation and testing |
| DesignToken | Standardized variable for color, spacing, typography, or motion |
| ResearchReport | Summary of user research findings with recommendations |
| ComponentLibrary | Shared library of reusable UI components and patterns |

## Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|

| conductUsabilityTest | Run moderated or unmoderated usability sessions with target users |
| updateDesignSystem | Add, modify, or deprecate components in the shared design system |
| reviewDesignHandoff | Validate that implemented UI matches the approved design spec |
| auditAccessibility | Evaluate product surfaces against WCAG accessibility guidelines |

## Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| designSpecApproved | Design specification reviewed and approved for engineering handoff |
| prototypeValidated | Prototype tested with users and confirmed as directionally sound |
| usabilityTestCompleted | User research session concluded with findings documented |
| designSystemUpdated | New or modified components published to the design system |
| accessibilityAuditCompleted | Accessibility review finished with issues logged and prioritized |

## Searches

| Search | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| findDesignSpecs | Search design specifications by product area or approval status |
